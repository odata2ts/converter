# Common Converters

Common converters compatible with [odata2ts](https://github.com/odata2ts/odata2ts).

## Conversions

| OData Type           | Converter Id                  |    Data Type     |  Description                                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|:----------------:|---------------------------------------------|
| `Edm.DateTimeOffset` | dateTimeOffsetToDateConverter |      `Date`      | Conversion to JS' date instance             |
| `Edm.Duration`       | simpleDurationConverter       | `SimpleDuration` | Result data type is provided by the package |
| `Edm.Int64`          | int64ToBigIntConverter        |     `bigint`     | Converts to JS' built-in `bigint` type      |

By default, only the `dateTimeOffsetToDateConverter` is included when the whole converter package is used.
It's rather intended to pick the converters you need.

### `SimpleDuration`
Converts duration string (e.g. `P12YT09H13S`) into a simple duration object:
```ts
export interface SimpleDuration {
  years?: number;
  months?: number;
  days?: number;
  hours?: number;
  minutes?: number;
  seconds?: number;
}
```
Note: `seconds` can be a fraction to represent milliseconds, e.g. `23.123` = 23 sec and 123 ms
